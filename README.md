# J.I.M Game

In 2022, our team of 3 people (Leonid Maznitsa, Anton Jaštšuk, and Allan Ivanov) wrote a rogue-like game "J.I.M Game" using Godot language as a task for the university project.

## Game Process

The main task of this game is to eliminate all enemies and go to the next level. The amount of levels is infinite and after each level game becomes a bit harder (more enemies or more bullets needed to destroy them).
